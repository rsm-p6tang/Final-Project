# About this project 
Formula 1 (F1) racing is a high-stakes sport where race outcomes are influenced by multiple factors, including driver performance, pit stop efficiency, and circuit characteristics. This study aims to analyze the impact of pit stop strategies and circuit attributes on race results. Using data from F1 races between 2020 and 2024, we apply machine learning models to determine how pit stop timing, number of stops, and circuit-specific elements influence race outcomes. Our results suggest that optimizing pit stop strategies can significantly enhance a driver's final position, with certain circuits requiring more aggressive strategies than others.
